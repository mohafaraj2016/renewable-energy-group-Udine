# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## âœ… 1. Ensure the environment is set

cd your-project-folder
### `npm install`


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

# âœ… 2. Stage, commit, and push your changes
# Run the following commands in your terminal:
### `git add .`
### `git commit -m "Update data preview and plotting features"`
### `git push origin main`

# If your branch is called something other than main (e.g., master or gh-pages), change main to match.

# âœ… 3. Build your React app

This generates the static files to be deployed: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

# âœ… 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages
Assuming youâ€™re using gh-pages (which you probably already configured), run:

### `npm run deploy`

This will automatically push the contents of the build/ directory to the gh-pages branch and update your public webpage.

# ðŸ§ª 5. Verify deployment

Visit:
https://mohafaraj2016.github.io/renewable-energy-group-Udine/

or your custom domain, if you configured one (like a university subdomain).

# ðŸ“Œ Optional: If npm run deploy fails

Make sure your package.json contains:
### `"homepage": "https://mohafaraj2016.github.io/renewable-energy-group-Udine",`
#### `"scripts": {`
###  ...
###  `"predeploy": "npm run build",`
###  `"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"`
### `}`

And that gh-pages is installed:

### `npm install --save gh-pages`




See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
